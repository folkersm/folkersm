<h2>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate game development enthusiast with a keen interest in math and programming. I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

<h2>Projects</h2>
I'll be sharing my game development projects on this GitHub repository. I'm working on a few game ideas at the moment and plan on making them avilable to play on a web browser. 

<h2>Interests</h2>
My primary focus is on mathematics, which I believe is critical for designing interesting game mechanics. I like to seperate game mechanics from game artwork and focus primarily on the mechanical aspects of the game. I'm a big fan of puzzle games, and turn-based strategy games. 

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects related to game development. If you have any interesting projects or ideas, feel free to reach out to me. I'm eager to learn from others and contribute to the community.
